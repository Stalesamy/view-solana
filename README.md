## Transact NFTs in a jiffy.

View is an Augmented Reality marketplace for transacting NFTs on the Solana Blockchain, built in the hackathon, for Solana. It provides a seamless process to buy and sell physical and even digital NFTs. Simply point your camera at the artwork or sticker representing a digital NFT and purchase it on the spot.

### Current Build

The current build is a Unity3d release, it's very beta, originally we were working on a different stack that is more open source friendly and easier to integrate, that is in the works.


### Future Plans

We have quite a bit in mind! We'll update this soon!

### How it works? 

Once installed the user can link a wallet with their account and begin buying/selling NFTs in the Solana ecosystem using their phone camera. An artist's NFTs will be processed and be available as 'Augmentable', any user signed in within the app can find the physical art and purchase it by bringing the NFT within the field of view in the camera scene and completing the transaction entirely within the same window with a few clicks. Artist's can opt in for designing a sticker that can be the actual NFT in sticker-form or a marker, for the harder to process NFTs, the natural feature tracking algorithm that allows for targetting is robust, but if the NFT is a soundbyte or a dozen pixels, then a marker will replace the NFT in that form, while still allowing for the seamless transaction View provides.
