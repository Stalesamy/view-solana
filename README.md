## Transact NFTs in a jiffy.

View is an Augmented Reality marketplace for transacting NFTs on the Solana Blockchain, built during the SolanaSZN hackathon, for the Solana community. It provides a seamless process for buying and selling NFTs. Simply point your camera at the artwork or sticker or any image target representing an NFT, and purchase it on the spotf, no QR codes.

### Current Build

The current build is a Unity3d release, it's very beta, you can use it to view the price of the helium zodiac NFT's metaplex.helium.com , we printed out some still images as targets for each of the zodiacs and in the demo you can see the live auction data being augmented on the image target along with a buy/bid button. When you tap the buy button, it takes you to the website where you can sign in with your sollet/phantom wallet to place a bid.

### Future Plans
  
  Whitelist first batch of artists,
  Pull images from arweave and create augmentable image targets from an NFT lising on our Metaplex storefront,
  User generated augmentation,
  Transactions (Buy/Bid) from within the mobile app,
  Live datafeed for auction price,
  Time left,
  Seamlessly purchase and interact with real world NFTs either in a gallery, landmark, or on a sticker in an arbitrary location.

### How it works? 

Once installed the user can link a wallet with their account and begin buying/selling NFTs within the Solana ecosystem using View. An artist's NFT(s) will be processed and be available as 'Augmentable', any user signed in within the app can find the physical art and purchase it by bringing the NFT within the field of view in the camera scene and completing the transaction entirely within the same window with a few clicks. Artist's can opt in for designing a sticker that can be the actual NFT in sticker-form or a marker, for the harder to process NFTs, the natural feature tracking algorithm that allows for targetting is robust, but if the NFT is a soundbyte or a dozen pixels, then a marker will replace the NFT in that form, while still allowing for the seamless transaction View provides.
